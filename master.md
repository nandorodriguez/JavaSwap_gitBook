### Is it a fair launch for everyone?

YES. At JavaSwap we have taken great strides to ensure that the launch is fair and equitable for everyone by adding multiple anti-whale mechanisms, anti-bot mechanisms and security measures, so that smaller JAVA holders can yield the benefits of acquiring JAVA without most of the supply being purchased by whales. As the peopleâ€™s token we know that all people should have fair and equal access to purchasing JAVA. We have designed our platform with these values and principles in mind.

### When does the presale begin and end?

The presale lasts a maximum of 4 days from June 9th to June 12th. So make sure to come early and get some JAVA before it all sells out. If you are late, then donâ€™t worry. You can get JAVA from our swap section at [https://javaswap.io/swap](https://javaswap.io/swap).

### When is the official launch date?

The official launch date is June 9th at 00:00 UTC. What is the total amount of JAVA that can be purchased/ owned by one address?

![](.gitbook/assets/grupo-1115.png) There is no address based limit, but the sale is structured to prevent whales and bots from buying up the supply before the smaller guys.

What price are the tokens at presale?

![](.gitbook/assets/grupo-1115.png) The price of JAVA is $0.10 USDC up to $1000 worth. Once $1000 is reached the price begins to get higher to prevent whales from scooping up large amounts at a discounted rate.
