### Audits

To ensure security and value for the JAVA token and community users. We are undergoing multiple audits by different security professionals such as TechRate, HashEx and Certix. We take our code quality very seriously and all these auditors are well known in the industry for rigorous evaluation with their world-renowned quality assurance, testing and auditing procedures. 

Here is list of our completed JavaSwap Smart contract audits:

### **Migration code**

At JavaSwap, we have done everything to make sure that our projects are secure and that your assets are secure. Being part of the community ourselves we know how important community support is and that the community is self-assured by the security of our project. Therefore, we have been rigorously audited and found to have bugless code by 4 different highly reputable auditors. As shown here in our smart contracts documentation, our smart contracts have been audited and ensured that they are secure. We have tried out hardest to ensure bug free smart contracts and to keep your tokens safe.

### Source code

Due to our transparent and decentralized nature, all of our code is open source and available for public and professional scrutiny on GitHub, anyone interested in reviewing and analyzing the code can easily do so. You can also make contributions to our code base in exchange for JAVA. Also a reward for bug bounties will be established. and paid in JAVA.

### Potential Risks

Disclaimer: only invest what can afford to lose, and all investments have risks.

All projects carry a degree of risk, here at JavaSwap we have seeked to prevent, mitigate and combat potential risks, yet some level of risk is inherent in all projects. We have rigorously had the smart contracts audited by several parties as code quality is of foremost importance to the team. Despite this there are always risks when using an AMM, understanding these risks is the responsibility of all community users.

Here are some potential risks:

Smart contract exploits - Although this is extremely unlikely, a new zero day exploit could be discovered in the smart contract, or despite our audits a potential exploit could have eluded the auditors. Impermanent loss- You could have impermanent loss when providing liquidity to LPâ€™s. If you donâ€™t understand impermanent loss and its associated risks click here. \(hyperlink to impermanent loss explanation/risks\) Hackers - Hackers are always a looming threat for every CEX, DEX and AMM, however we have sought to mitigate against this via meticulous code quality, rigorous security and smart contract audits. All of these combine to vastly diminish the chances a hacker successfully exploits a bug in our code. Java token value loss- There is also the potential risk that JAVA once purchased could decline in value.
