# ðŸ’°Javanomics

Skip this section till Andres/ Carlos inform me of the tokenomics they decide upon. However there is a file with all this information in the JAVASWAP folder, but obviously will need to be changed once they finalised. Then maybe I can add this information.

### **JAVA token**

The JAVA token is the main token of JavaSwap

### **Burning**

JavaSwap incorporates a burning mechanism for the JAVA token making JAVA even more scarce, thus increasing itâ€™s value even more.        

Every monday we will do the majority of our token burn to optimise our tokenâ€™s synergy within an equilibrium mechanism of  token creation mechanism and token burn. Which enables us to create the most optimal valuation of our token. 

We have created a diverse suite of fun games such as Lucky lotto, JavaBid and JavaFlip to support the burning mechanism. However, the games are not the totality of our burning of JAVA!

### **Fees**

Every time a swap transaction is made a slight fee is incurred upon that transaction which is then split into the following: 0.22% which is returned to the liquidity pools and the other 0.08% goes back to the JavaSwap treasury.  

### **Anti-whale mechanisms**

Place a hyperlink the anti-whale mechanisms page listed in security

### **Anti-whale community protection**

Here at JavaSwap weâ€™ve implemented multiple protection mechanisms to maximise security ****and to ensure the best interests of the community. This is why we take our security with utmost seriousness, we are audited all our smart contracts. Therefore we have implemented the following mechanism to ensure the stability of our ecosystem: 

One of the features weâ€™re providing to protect the community is that we will undergo a anti-whale mechanism to _p_revent whales from hoarding massive amounts of Java. The maximum amount of JAVA that can be purchased is 1,000 USDC per transaction, but if you want more tokens the price will incrementally increase. The higher the demand, the higher the price. \(Place chart\)

Another anti-whale feature is that our presale prevents whales from buying massive amounts at a discounted price by limiting the orders per account, so a whale can not use an account to purchase lots of small orders to keep the initial token offering price \(10 JAVA for 1 MATIC or 5 JAVA for 1 USDC.\) Since JAVA is the peopleâ€™s token, we have created a fair and level playing field to ensure that smaller investors will flourish and that a small group of whales will not dominate and hold a large majority of the token supply. 

Anti-bot mechanism- We use a sophisticated CAPTCHA system to prevent bots from placing any orders. \(Coming soon\)
