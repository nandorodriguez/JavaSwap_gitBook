# üëäGetting started

### **Wallet creation**

Creating a wallet is a simple process. Firstly, you will require a wallet that is compatible with JavaSwap. To get started on JavaSwap, you will need to set up a wallet that supports JavaSwap such as Metamask. 

We recommend Metamask for simple setup and ease of use:

First, download Metamask for your browser. Make sure you download the correct Metamask extension for your browser and that you download it from the real website. Next, click create wallet, then follow the instructions on Metamask. You need to make a strong password, then write down your backup seed. This seed is essential as it allows you to recover your funds if you ever lose or forget your password.  Never send your password or backup seed to anybody as this will allow them to steal your money. Once you‚Äôve successfully set up Metamask and made your password, stored your seed safely on paper, then you can go to the Javaswap website and click the Connect Wallet button. Now you‚Äôre connected and ready to receive and send funds!

Polygon \(MATIC\) network also has a very in depth guide on how to create and configure MATIC on metamask.

### **Connecting your wallet to JavaSwap**

Connecting your wallet to Java Swap is as simple as sipping from your favourite coffee cup! First, download Metamask for your browser. Once you‚Äôve successfully set up Metamask and made your password, stored your seed safely on paper, then you can go to the Javaswap.io and click the Connect Wallet button. After a quick synchronization process, you are good to go! You can now buy, sell and swap assets on JavaSwap. Simple! \(Never share your password or seed with anyone under any circumstances.\)

### **How to get the JAVA token?**

Acquiring JAVA is a simple process. Once you‚Äôve clicked connect and connected your Metamask wallet to our DEX, you can swap any of the compatible pairs for JAVA such as USDT, USDC and, MATIC.

Other ways you can acquire more JAVA once you have brought your initial JAVA are through staking, yield farming and earning transaction fees through liquidity. 

### **Bridge ERC20 to MATIC/Polygon - Ones in red need changing**

What is the Polgyon \(MATIC\) ERC-20 bridge? 

The Polygon \(MATIC\) ERC-20 bridge is a two way bridge which allows ERC-20 tokens to be transferred to and from the Polygon network. This bridge is called Plasma bridge. Polygon network‚Äôs focus is on ERC-20 DeFi tokens. 

Using the bridge to transfer ERC-20 tokens

The Polygon network \(MATIC\) is a diverse network as it allows multiple token issuance protocols such as ERC-20 and BEP-20 and assets that use this standard to traverse across and use their low fees, high speed bridge.
