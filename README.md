## ![](.gitbook/assets/grupo-2565.svg)  AMM

An Automatic Market Maker \(AMM\) is a type of decentralized exchange that is permissionless and automated. It provides liquidity through automated algorithmic trading as opposed to the traditional centralized exchanges which use an order book system. Users supply Liquidity Pools with tokens which are then governed by a mathematical formula which algorithmically computes the asset's price.

## ![](.gitbook/assets/grupo-2671.svg)  Espresso Pools

The Liquidity Pools \(LPs\) on JavaSwap are known as Espresso pools, our Espresso pools function the exact same way as traditional pools on Uniswap and PancakeSwap. So anyone can provide liquidity via their tokens and earn JAVA. Any JavaSwap user can place their tokens in any pool we have available.

Choose your pool, stake your tokens, then sit back and watch your JAVA accumulate! Espresso pools allow you to stake your tokens in open pools and earn massive returns via the JAVA token. The process is simple and instant, place your tokens in the corresponding pool and then you'll instantly start earning JAVA yield based on the total amount staked.

## ![](.gitbook/assets/grupo-2695.svg) Java Farm

Hello JAVA farmers, it’s time to harvest some liquidity for a nice JAVA yield! In order to farm JAVA you need to provide liquidity to one of the available tokens in the Espresso pool which you can find on the farm page. JavaSwap users will need to allocate their 2 tokens in different farms in proportional amounts.

After providing liquidity and receiving your JAVA LP tokens, please select the pool from the farm page, approve the contract and click the plus sign, choosing the amount you want to stake and then confirm approval.
