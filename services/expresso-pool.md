The rewards don’t end here, however! You can earn even more by staking your JAVA tokens in Espresso Pool.

### How to add liquidity?

In order to farm you need to provide liquidity to one of the tokens in the Espresso pool which you can find on the JAVA farm page.

Adding and removing liquidity is as simple as clicking a few buttons! If you’ve used any AMM previously, then you know the drill. To farm JAVA, you need to first add liquidity to the exchange. To add liquidity you first need to connect your wallet to JavaSwap.

Navigate to Swap on the sidebar on the left, then click on Liquidity, hit Add Liquidity and select the token pair that you want to deposit. Simple!

### How to remove liquidity?

Removing liquidity is very similar to adding liquidity, you do the same steps as above, then you navigate to Swap on the sidebar on the left, after that click on Liquidity, click remove Liquidity, and select the token pair that you want to withdraw.
