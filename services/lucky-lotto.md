# Lucky Lotto

![](../.gitbook/assets/grupo-1066.jpg)

Lucky Lotto is a game similar to PancakeSwap’s lottery.

A Lucky Lotto ticket costs 1 JAVA per ticket. There is no ticket cap, however only 50 tickets can be purchased at once through our user interface. After a ticket is purchased, a random 4 digit number will be generated. The digits will be between 1-14. For example : “2-9-7-6”

When you win the Lucky Lotto jackpot, you will receive 50 percent of the whole lottery pool! In order to win, you need all 4 of the randomly generated numbers on your ticket to match the exact sequence of the 4 winning numbers.

However, even if you don’t win the jackpot, you can still win a lot of JAVA! At minimum, if you match 2 or more numbers in the correct sequence you will receive a reward. Here are all the possible ways to earn JAVA:

Match all 4 numbers in the exact order = win 50% of the pot \(or split the pot if there is more than 1 winner\). Match 3 numbers in the exact order = win or split 20% of the pot. Match 2 numbers in the exact order = win or split 10% of the pot. We burn the remaining 20% of the pot = if a minimum of 3 numbers aren't matched.

If there were no winners that matched 3 numbers during the Lucky Lotto draw, then the 20% allocated to winners will be burnt. Check our website under the Lucky Lotto section and you can see when a new Lucky Lotto game starts. Once the winning lottery numbers are drawn, they will appear on the page. The users with above 2 numbers in the correct sequence can claim their winnings and check the stats to see if any other people’s numbers matched as well. This includes those who got 2 correct numbers in the correct sequence as well as 3 and 4. The Lucky Lotto’s winning numbers are completely randomly generated and therefore no one can predict the winning numbers in advance and cheat.
